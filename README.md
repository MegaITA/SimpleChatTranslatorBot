# How to install

Firstly you must have NodeJS and TypeScript installed. Then, using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) via Telegram, you will obtain a bot token that you'll need later.

Create a new directory called `dist`:
```bash
mkdir dist
```
Once you've created it you have to install the needed dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```
Then you'll have to compile the project using:
```bash
npm run compile
```
Once you compiled it successfully you can run the bot by simply running:
```bash
npm run start
```
Or
```bash
cd dist
node bot.js
```
